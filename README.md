Our project is a collaboration dashboard that allows software teams to assign different teams different tasks. Then, if a team struggles on a specific part, they can tag the code, and get help or discuss solutions with the rest of the developers. Project managers can reward helpful team members and track progress. Overall this improves efficiency and assists in the organization of a project.
